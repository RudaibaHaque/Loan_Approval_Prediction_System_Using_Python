# Loan_Approval_Prediction_System_Using_Python

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a loan approval prediction system implemented in Python. The system aims to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not based on various parameters provided in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following parameters:

- Loan_ID
- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status
- LoanAmount_Log
- TotalIncome
- TotalIncome_Log

## Usage

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/RudaibaHaque/Loan_Approval_Prediction_System_Using_Python.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Loan_Approval_Prediction_System_Using_Python


3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the main Python script:

Loan Approval Prediction.ipynb


## Machine Learning Models

The system utilizes the following machine learning algorithms:

- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Results

The accuracy rates achieved by each algorithm are as follows:

- Random Forest: 0.68 %
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: 0.81 %
- Decision Tree: 0.58 %
- K-Nearest Neighbors: 0.80 %

Based on the evaluation, the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate for loan approval prediction.
